A `Block` is a unit to measure time and will always be 15 mins.

**Why 15 mins ?**

Because it's not too short and not too long; and it's easy for [mathing][1]

- 2 blocks = 30 mins
- 4 blocks = 1 hour
- 8 blocks = 2 hours
- 16 blocks = 4 hours
- 32 blocks = 8 hours 
- 96 blocks = 1 day (8hr work + 8hr sleep + 8hr your time)
